# etch_a_sketch-OP
A little recreation of the 1980s toy Etch A Sketch using hover listeners.

This is demonstration of some basic CSS along with using for loops and event listeners (hover) to change the color of squares on the grid. 

Each hover over a square will darken its color by 10%.

You can make the sketch grid larger by clicking the yellow button labeled, "Change Grid Size".

This will take a number between 8 and 35 and build a grid on the sketch pad to corresponding dimensions (i.e. 8 = 8x8, 35 = 35x35).

**NOTE: This is designed for desktop only and -will not- function nor look good on mobile.

That's it! Simple and sweet.
